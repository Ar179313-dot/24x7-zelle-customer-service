            <h2>About Zelle Payment Service</h2>
            <p>Zelle is a fast, safe, and easy way to send and receive money with friends, family, and others you trust, typically within minutes when both parties are enrolled. With just an email address or U.S. mobile number, you can send money directly from your bank account to someone else's. Many major banks and credit unions in the U.S. offer Zelle, making it convenient for millions of users. Unlike other payment apps, Zelle doesn't hold your money - transfers go directly into your bank account. The service is built into many banking apps, but also available as a standalone Zelle app for customers whose banks don't yet offer it. Zelle makes splitting bills, paying rent, or sending gifts as simple as sending a text message.</p>
            
            <h2>How Zelle Works</h2>
            <p>To use Zelle, you first need to enroll through your banking app or the Zelle app using your U.S. mobile number or email address. Once enrolled, you can send money by selecting someone from your contacts or entering their email/mobile number. The recipient gets a notification about the payment and, if they're already enrolled with Zelle, the money goes directly into their bank account, typically within minutes. If the recipient isn't enrolled, they'll receive instructions to do so to claim the money. There are no fees to send or receive money with Zelle, and you can use it with most major U.S. banks and credit unions. The service is designed for sending money to people you know and trust, not for business transactions or purchases from strangers.</p>
            
            <h2>Zelle Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>Zelle transactions are typically instant and irreversible, which means refunds aren't automatic. If you sent money to the wrong person, you should contact them immediately to request a return payment. For unauthorized transactions, contact your bank's fraud department right away at +1-877-311-0689. Zelle recommends only sending money to people you know and trust. If you're a victim of a scam, report it to your bank immediately - while banks aren't required to refund money in these cases, some may offer protection depending on the circumstances. Always double-check recipient information before sending, as transactions to enrolled users are completed in minutes and cannot be canceled. For merchant purchases, Zelle isn't recommended as it doesn't offer purchase protection.</p>
            
            <h2>Zelle Login and Enrollment Issues</h2>
            <p>If you're having trouble enrolling in Zelle or logging in, first ensure your bank participates in Zelle. Enrollment issues often occur when using an email or phone number already associated with another Zelle account. For login problems, check that you're using the correct credentials - some users have separate login details for their bank and Zelle. If locked out, use the "Forgot Password" option or contact your bank's support. The Zelle app requires a U.S. mobile number, and some prepaid phones may not be eligible. If your bank offers Zelle, you must enroll through their online banking rather than the standalone app. Common issues can often be resolved by updating your banking app, clearing cache, or trying a different device.</p>
            
            <h2>Zelle Not Working? Common Problems</h2>
            <p>When Zelle isn't working, first check your internet connection and ensure your banking app is updated. Common issues include transactions failing because the recipient isn't enrolled, hitting daily/weekly sending limits, or using an unsupported bank account. Some banks impose holds on first-time Zelle transactions for security. If a payment is pending longer than expected, contact both your bank and the recipient's bank. For "Payment Failed" errors, verify you have sufficient funds and correct recipient details. Zelle services may be temporarily unavailable during bank maintenance periods. If problems persist, contact Zelle customer service at +1-877-311-0689 for assistance. Remember that Zelle is designed for personal, not business use, and some transaction patterns may trigger security holds.</p>
